# GrappleTweaks

Swing through the air the way it was meant to be! Grapple Tweaks enhances the grapple gun to allow you to swing while the grapple gun bolt is anchored to something. You can use multiple at once, and even put them in your quickbelt while swinging.
This mod also allows you slide in any direction while holding onto a zipline.

## Usage
- Grapple Gun Swinging
    1. Activate the swinging mode on the grapple gun by pressing the "Pull" button while the grapple is fully retracted
    2. The mode indicator light will turn blue, indicating that you are now in swinging mode
    3. When a grapple line is out, you can now press the "Pull" button to slowly retract your grapple line
- Bi-Directional Zipline Sliding
    1. While holding the slide button on a zipline, also hold the "Powered Slide" button (AX button on streamlined, and south on the touchpad with normal controls)
    2. You will now accelerate in the direction your head is facing (it is not instant, and will take time to get up to speed)

## Installation
1. Install the latest x64 version of [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
2. Unzip this mod into your BepInEx/plugins folder

## Known Issues
- When rappeling directly up a vertical wall, you may phase into it and become stuck (I'm still working on a way around this)
